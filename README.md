# receiptgo

A cli program to assist with downloading RingGo receipts.

RingGo's app only lets you download a single receipt at a time, which means a
tedious process if you park a lot.

## Running

    cargo run -- --username='<EMAIL-OR-PHONE-NUMBER>' --password='<PASSWORD>' --client-secret='<CLIENT-SECRET>'
